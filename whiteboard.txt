Setup:
	Install python
	
	Set up a virtual environment if wanted:
		pip install virtualenv
		in projects root directory: virtualenv venv
		activate venvm: windows - .\venv\Scripts\activate, mac/linux - source venv/bin/activate
		deactivate venvm: deactivate
		add venv to .gitignore
	
	install delpendencies from requirements.txt
	How to create requirements.txt?
		pip freeze > requirements.txt
			This command will generate a list of all the installed packages in your current virtual environment (or system Python installation if not using a virtual environment), along with their version numbers, and save this list to a file named requirements.txt.
		or add manually, find versions using pip freeze
